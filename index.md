# Eastville community running and fitness club.

<strong>Bristol, UK.</strong>

<em>We are on a mission to raise £1500 for <a href="http://www.glenfrome.bristol.sch.uk/">Glenfrome Primary School</a>.  We're a group of parents who have dabbled with a bit of running, to varying degrees of success. But now we’re ready to take on a mega challenge: The <a href="http://www.greatrun.org/great-bristol-half-marathon">Bristol Half Marathon</a>, and in doing so raise some serious cash for our fantastic local primary school.</em>

<a href="http://www.glenfrome.bristol.sch.uk/">Glenfrome primary school</a> is a fantastic inner city school, serving a diverse community in the East of Bristol.

For the first time in it’s history in 2016 the school was judged to be ‘good’ by Ofsted.  This is down to the hard work and outstanding dedication of the head teacher, the staff and pupils of the school.  Everyone continues to work so hard for, and within the school.

Our children love going to school at Glenfrome; supporting the school financially is a great opportunity for us, especially as nearly all schools are facing budget constraints.  We hope to add some money to a pot that can be used directly to encourage and engage our children in being active.
