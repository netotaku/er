    <h1>Fund Raising for Glenfrome Primary</h1>
    <p>We are on a mission to raise <em>£1500</em> for <a href="http://www.glenfrome.bristol.sch.uk/" target="_window">Glenfrome Primary School</a>. We’re a group of parents who have dabbled with a bit of running, to varying degrees of success. But now we’re ready to take on a mega challenge: <a href="http://www.greatrun.org/great-bristol-half-marathon">The Bristol Half Marathon</a>, and in doing so raise some serious cash for our fantastic local primary school.</p>
    <p>All our children love going to school at Glenfrome; supporting the school financially is a great opportunity for us, as nearly all schools are facing budget constraints. We are planning to raise funds that can be used directly to encourage and engage our children in being active. Our lovely school has acres of grounds that are perfect to enable our children to develop a love of physical activity.</p>
    <p>The money we raise will predominantly be put towards buying additional out door play equipment. We're hoping we'll be able to contribute to the purchase of a new obstacle course, and if we raise enough we may also be able to help the school investment in a new stage for drama and performance, in the main hall.</p>
    <p>We’ll be taking part in a series of different races over the summer, of varying distance, as we work towards that first big challenge. Stay tuned to our pages to find out how we're getting on!</p>
